# HW1
the measure_runtime function in the code tests the runime of Recursive_Binary_Search for a given input size by repeatdly running the algorthm a large number of times and then calculating the average runtime. The algorithm creates a sorted list, sets a target element outside of that list so each input size will need to search through the entire list in order to fully complete, measure the full time it takes for the whole opporation to complete and divides the totla runtime by the nubmber of total test runs. This shows the average runtime it takes to preform the binary search at each input size. When running the code the plot graph shows that the binary seach algorithm's run time is O(log(n))
